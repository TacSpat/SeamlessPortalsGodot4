# SeamlessPortalsGodot4


Near Seamless portals I made in about a week for the Godot 4 Engine. Not everything here is perfect, but I got an example scene to run fine.

WHAT THESE DO:

walk through them with near seamless effect

WHAT THESE DONT DO:

-object clipping
-taking objects with you(multiple objects)
-recursive portals
